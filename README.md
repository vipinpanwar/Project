This repository include my B.tech projects.
Crime Prediction : (May 1 2018 to June 10 2018)
◦ The aim of this project to determine the type of crime. The dataset has been downloaded from the
Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime ) and programming used in python. The ide or tools
which I used for the project is google colaboratory and jupyter. Google colaboratory is an online tool I
used this tool to train my model in the cloud.
◦ Model is trained in cloud and the accuracy is 96.7%


• Student Performance Prediction : (March 3 2018 to April 10 2018)
◦ At this technical project, I predict the student performance. The Dataset has been download from
the UCI website (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance). This Dataset has
33 Attribute and this is a regression problem.
◦ The tool which used for this project is orange.


• Central Repository System in Socket Programming in C : (December 2 2017 to March 1 2018)
◦ At this technical project, we made the Central server in which any client can upload the file for sharing
and also download the other user file.
◦ For handling the multiple users we use POSIX thread inc. To send data over the socket we use system
calls.
◦ At Server, there is a repository file which contains the list of all the file that present in the server.
Whenever users upload the file Server update this repository file at runtime.


• Air Quality : (September 14 2017 to October 10 2017)
◦ At this technical project, I predict the amount of C6H6 in the air. The dataset has been download from
the UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+quality).
◦ This is a regression problem and the tool used for this project is python and orange.
